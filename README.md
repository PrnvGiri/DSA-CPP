## Introduction

Data structures are fundamental building blocks of software, and algorithms are the procedures for processing and manipulating data. This repository serves as a reference for various data structures and algorithms implementations. It covers a wide range of programming languages to cater to different preferences and learning objectives.

## Data Structures

### Arrays

Arrays are one of the simplest and most widely used data structures. They store a collection of elements in a linear sequence and allow for efficient access, insertion, and deletion of elements.

### Linked Lists

Linked lists are a data structure where elements are connected by references or pointers. They come in various forms like singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists.

### Stacks

Stacks are a data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. They are often used for managing function calls and maintaining state in algorithms.

### Queues

Queues are a data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. They are commonly used for managing tasks and handling resources.

### Trees

Trees are hierarchical data structures that are used in a wide range of applications, such as representing hierarchical relationships and organizing data efficiently. Common types of trees include binary trees, AVL trees, and heaps.

### Graphs

Graphs are a versatile data structure used to represent various relationships and networks. This section includes various graph algorithms as well.

### Hash Tables

Hash tables provide efficient key-value mapping, making them ideal for implementing dictionaries and associative arrays.

## Algorithms

### Sorting

Sorting algorithms are used to arrange elements in a particular order. Common sorting algorithms include bubble sort, quicksort, and mergesort.

### Searching

Searching algorithms are used to find a specific element in a dataset. Binary search and linear search are examples of searching algorithms.

### Graph Algorithms

Graph algorithms are used to analyze and manipulate graphs. Examples include depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS).

### Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming is a technique used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems. This section includes dynamic programming algorithms like the Fibonacci sequence and the knapsack problem.

### Other Algorithms

This section includes various other algorithms not covered in the above categories. Examples include string matching algorithms and greedy algorithms.
